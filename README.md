# lostmediafinder

Currently YouTube is the only supported site, but that might change.

Contributions are welcome!

## CLI tool
Currently no documentation exists for the CLI tool.

## Usage as a module
There are docstrings included in the module (it is contained in `lostmediafinder`), but no `setup.py` or PyPI package is currently included. This is because it is not yet 100% stable (and I plan on adding support for more websites soon).

## Frontend
### Running in Docker(recommended):
There is an included Dockerfile that should work 100% fine.
  
If it doesn't work that is considered a bug, as it is the only supported method of running the site.
